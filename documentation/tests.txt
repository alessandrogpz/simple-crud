Run the tests by executing the command 'make test' in your project's root directory. 

To ensure that all tests are always correctly executed, always execute "make clean", then "make test" everytime one wants to execute a test. 

in addition to the test target, there are two new targets test_simple_test_1 and test_simple_test_2. 
For example: Running 'make test_simple_test_1' will compile and execute only the simple_test_1.cpp file, 
and running 'make test_simple_test_2' will compile and execute only the simple_test_2.cpp file. 
You can add more test targets as needed for other test files.
