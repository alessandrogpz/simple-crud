Compiling with G++

Assuming you have saved your source code file as sqlite_test.cpp, you can compile and link it with the SQLite library using the following commands:

g++ -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11 sqlite_test.cpp -o example -lsqlite3


This command will compile sqlite_test.cpp using g++, link it with the SQLite library, and output the executable file example. 
To run the program, you can use the following command:

./example

This will execute the example executable and run the program.
Note that you need to have the SQLite library installed on your system for this to work.

makefile

To use makefile in conjunction with SQLite, you should update your Makefile by adding the -lsqlite3 flag to the linker command

LDLIBS = <other libraies> -lsqlite3
