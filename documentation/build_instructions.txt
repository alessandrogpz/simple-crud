while inside source folder, type:
g++ main.cpp read.cpp users.cpp write.cpp <other-.cpp-files> -o ../bin/<program-name>

makefile:
You can create a Makefile to automate the compilation process for your project. 
A Makefile is a special file that contains rules for how to build your program from its source code. 
It allows you to specify dependencies between your source files and the executable file, 
and it automates the build process by running the compiler and linker commands for you.

CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11
LDFLAGS =

SRCDIR = src
OBJDIR = obj
BINDIR = bin

SRCS = $(wildcard $(SRCDIR)/*.cpp)
OBJS = $(patsubst $(SRCDIR)/%.cpp,$(OBJDIR)/%.o,$(SRCS))
TARGET = $(BINDIR)/myprogram

all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
	$(CXX) $(LDFLAGS) $^ -o $@

$(OBJDIR)/%.o: $(SRCDIR)/%.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

clean:
	rm -f $(OBJS) $(TARGET)

.PHONY: all clean

Here's a brief explanation of what each section does:

CXX is the compiler you're using (here we're using g++).
CXXFLAGS are the compiler flags you want to pass to the compiler (such as -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11).
LDFLAGS are the linker flags you want to pass to the linker (such as -lm to link with the math library).
SRCDIR, OBJDIR, and BINDIR are the directories where your source files, object files, and executable files will be stored.
SRCS is a list of all your source files (here we're using the wildcard function to get all .cpp files in the SRCDIR directory).
OBJS is a list of all your object files (here we're using the patsubst function to convert all .cpp files in the SRCDIR directory to .o files in the OBJDIR directory).
TARGET is the name of your executable file.
The all target is the default target that will be built if you just run make.
The $(TARGET) target depends on all of your object files ($(OBJS)) and builds your executable file.
The $(OBJS) target depends on the corresponding .cpp file and builds the corresponding .o file.
The clean target removes all of your object files and your executable file.
The .PHONY target lists all of the targets that don't actually build files.
To use this Makefile, save it to a file called Makefile in the root directory of your project. Then, run the command make to build your program. The make command will automatically compile all of your source files and link them together into an executable file called myprogram in the bin directory.

If you add new source files to your project, you just need to update the SRCS variable in the Makefile and run make again to rebuild your program.
